Project: Recommended - A Book Recommendation System

Description:
The "Recommended" package provides book recommendation functionalities using various machine learning models. It supports multiple recommendation techniques, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Cosine Similarity. This package is designed to help users find books similar to their preferences.

Key Features:
- Book recommendation system using KNN
- Cosine similarity-based book recommendations
- Popular book identification based on user preferences
- Streamlit integration for a web interface

Files:
- popular_books.py: Contains logic for fetching and displaying popular books.
- recommended_books.py: Contains the main logic for recommending books based on different algorithms.
- recommend_knn.py: Implements the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for book recommendations.
- recommend_cosine.py: Uses cosine similarity to suggest similar books.
- compute_similarity.py: Computes similarity between books based on features like genre or description.

How to Install:
To install the "Recommended" package, run the following command:

pip install recommended/

How to Use:
After installation, you can use the functionalities in your Python code.

Example:
from recommended import get_popular_books, recommend_knn

# Get popular books
popular_books = get_popular_books()

# Get book recommendations using KNN
recommended_books = recommend_knn(book_id=1)

For a Streamlit interface, you can use:

streamlit run app.py

Where app.py contains the streamlit interface logic for displaying book recommendations.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- streamlit
